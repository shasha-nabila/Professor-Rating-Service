# Professor Rating Service

A RESTful web service for students to rate professors, developed as part of the Web Services and Web Data module at the University of Leeds. The system includes a Django-based backend API and a Python command-line client.

## üåê Live Service
Hosted at: [https://sc22snba.pythonanywhere.com](https://sc22snba.pythonanywhere.com)

## üìå Features

### Backend (Django + Django REST Framework)
- User registration, login, logout (JWT authentication)
- View all modules and their associated professors
- View professor ratings (overall and module-specific)
- Submit ratings for professors in specific module instances
- Robust validation and error handling
- Admin dashboard for managing data

### Client (Python CLI)
- Command-driven interface for interacting with the API
- Secure session-based actions using stored JWT tokens
- Error handling for common failures (network, input, etc.)

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

- **Professor**: `identifier`, `name`
- **Module**: `code`, `name`, `year`, `semester`, `professors`
- **Rating**: `user`, `professor`, `module`, `year`, `semester`, `score`

Relationships:
- Professors teach many modules (many-to-many)
- Users can rate professors once per module instance
- Ratings link professors, modules, and users
